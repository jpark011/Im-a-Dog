# I'm a dog!

We are Karen, Jay and JB (team #16). This is our term project for course **CS 446** at uWaterloo (Winter 2018). 


## Motivation

We wanted to make a **party game** which uses the **features of mobile devices** (Bluetooth, camera, etc...). The game should:
* Be **easy** to install and setup
* Have a **simple concept** to learn and play
* Encourage **social interactions**.


## Concept

The game is called *I'm a dog!*. It's an adaptation of the *Mafia* game (or *Werewolf*), and features cats and dogs. 

The game is to be played by a group of friends (from 4 to 16 people) using several phones connected with Bluetooth. In the group, some players are secretly chosen to be *cats*, while the others are *dogs*. The goal of each team is to eliminate all players of the other team. 

The game consists of three repeating phases:

* In the **activity phase**, the players will take part in an activity. They will be given instructions and will have to answer on their phones. The instructions are slightly different depending on the team of the player. All the answers will be then displayed to the players, and form the basis for the voting phase. 

* In the **voting phase**, the players will have to argue and vote one person out. The goal of the cats is to blend in and act as dogs, justifying their answers to the previous activity. The goal of the dogs is to figure out and expose the cats. 

* In the **secret phase**, the cats will gather and vote to kill someone.
